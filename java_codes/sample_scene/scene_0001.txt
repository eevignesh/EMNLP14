FROM POV OF A HAND---HELD VIDEO CAMERA from inside the house... A car pulls up.
JOHN SANTOS, 30, Latino, dress shirt (no tie), slacks, cellphone on belt (think Radio Shack manager), gets out, a six---pack of beer under his arm.
He walks across the lawn, circles around to the back door... NOW FROM POV OF --DATELINE-----style fixed surveillance video cameras... we see Santos enter.
HEAVY METAL ON THE STEREO.
Santos moves through the house, looking around.
JOHN SANTOS speaks a dialogue.
No answer.
He spies a note on the fridge tacked up by a magnet: ---Chill out.
I'm in the shower.
-- Santos smiles.
He notices steam coming from under the bathroom door down the hall, hears the shower.
He pops a beer, calls toward the bathroom:  JOHN SANTOS (cont'd) speaks a dialogue.
He starts to unbutton his shirt, move toward the bathroom.
A SHADOW falls across the floor.
He turns.
TRANSITIONING NOW TO OBJECTIVE FILM POV... A BASEBALL BAT comes at him.
It clocks him, sends him to the carpet, unconscious... HANDS IN HEAVY GLOVES duct---tape his legs, drag him to a CHAIR.
