CLOSE ON A LAPTOP SCREEN: VICTIM #5, 35---ish, bruised and bloodied, stares out at us with frightened eyes.
PAN OFF THE LAPTOP SCREEN to find VICTIM #5 lashed with duct tape to a chair; a VIDEO CAMERA there.
Elaine Tillman stands over him.
ELAINE TILLMAN speaks a dialogue.
Her eyes are filled with hatred and, in this moment, control.
She cuts the last of the duct tape with a kitchen knife as... FRONT DOOR SPLINTERS OPEN.
SHOUTS OF "FBI!
FBI!
-- Megan, David and the SWAT TEAM surge into the room, guns out.
ANOTHER SWAT TEAM enters from the back.
But Elaine has the drop on her victim, behind him.
Kitchen knife to his throat.
MEGAN speaks a dialogue.
Elaine's resolve is weakening.
Megan's almost got her ----  MEGAN (cont'd) speaks a dialogue.
Beat.
Elaine drops the knife, crumbles under the weight of the guilt she's been carrying.
A SWAT TEAM MEMBER takes her into custody, as VICTIM #5 looks to Megan and David, shaken.
